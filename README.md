# Tour_De_France
This repository is a part of my curriculum 'Data Storytelling and Visualization'. This project involves web-scraping, cleaning and analyzing the Tour de France data set. The website that was identified was the Tour de France section of Cycling Archives, a website that maintains a database of all the cycling events and their winers. This project was performed using:
1) Requests and Beautiful Soup for web-scraping
2) NumPy and Pandas for Data Normalization and analysis
3) Seaborn for visualization and
4) Tableau for creating dashboards.

There are four Jupyter notebooks used here:
1) Tour-De-France.ipynb contains the web-scraping process followed to gather data from Cycling Archives
2) cleaning_cyclists_data.ipynb contains the data cleaning process followed using NumPy and Pandas
3) Data_Preprocessing.ipynb contains the data-preprocessing steps and
4) Data Visualization Steps.ipynb contains the analysis and visualization performed using NumPy, Pandas and Seaborn.
